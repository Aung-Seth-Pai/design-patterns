# Python Design Patterns Implementation

This repository contains my implementations of various design patterns in Python. It serves as both a reference and a documentation of my learning activities.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by design patterns, with each pattern implementation in its own directory:

- `observer_pattern/` - Implementation of the Observer Pattern

## Learning Resources
- [RefactoringGuru Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) - Excellent visual explanations of design patterns
- [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/) - For a more practical and engaging approach
- YouTube Tutorials:
  - [Christopher Okhravi's Design Pattern Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)
  - [Derek Banas' Design Patterns Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF206E906175C7E07)
 - [Implementation in Java of GoF book by Sayar Thet Khine with awesome book in Burmese for OOP & Design patterns](https://github.com/mrthetkhine/designpattern)

## Usage

Each pattern implementation includes a `main.py` file that demonstrates how to use the pattern. To run any example:

```bash
cd pattern_directory
python main.py
```
